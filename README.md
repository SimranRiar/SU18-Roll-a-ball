Unity Tutorial roll a ball for summer 2018 547:415

We will use this repository to get used to the workflow I want you to use in this class.

First, I will show you how to create a unity project and configure it for source control management in github.

Then I will push the project to this repository.

Once the project is in the repo, fork it to your personal account.

Then use github desktop to clone the repository to your local system.

Make sure to pay attention to which directory (where on your ocal drive) you have cloned the repository

it might be Desktop\github
it might be users\username\Documents\github
it might be somewhere else
If you are not sure where it is and we are in lab together, see me. It is better for you to work with the proper copy of the project than to slam it in to the repository directory after the fact.
